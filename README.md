- Then created a node application called `bamazonCustomer.js`.
    - Command needed to run the application:
    
          - node bamazonCustomer.js
    
    - Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. 
    - Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale
    - It will then prompt the user/buyer with two messages:
      - The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
      - The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy. 
    - Once the customer has placed the order, `bamazon` application should check the store if it has enough of the product to meet the  customer's request.
     - If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through like the shown below.

 -  However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
      - This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.

    - Once the update goes through, it will show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
